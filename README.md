# Efficiently_constructing_Insertion_Tableau_for_permutations

Young Tableau are widely utilized in combinatorics, cryptography, representation theory etc. Every application has an inherent need for constructing a Young's tableau efficiently. Young Tableau consists of two parts namely the Insertion Tableau(P) and the Recording Tableau(Q). The procedure of transforming the input permutation(σ) into tableau is known as the RSK algorithm. Each element from σ is inserted into P, consequently displacing/bumping other elements from the tableau, whereas Q records the order in which these elements were inserted into P. 

I have devised a new method to improve the number of comparisons required in the construction of insertion tableau from the permutation(σ). The number of comparisons mainly take place in searching for a position where the next element can be inserted in P. In order to solve this problem, we consider P along with the pointer matrix which stores the pointers to the elements in P and gets updated whenever a new element gets inserted into P or displaced from row of P. We use a combination of linear search and binary search on P to find the correct location for inserting an element(α) from the permutation(σ). The devised algorithm beats the standard RSK algorithm using binary search and Fast RSK by Tiskin by approximately 30%.
